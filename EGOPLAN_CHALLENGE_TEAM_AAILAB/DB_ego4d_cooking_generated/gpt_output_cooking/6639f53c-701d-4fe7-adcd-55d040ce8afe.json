First, we will identify the overall goal, then segment the video into coarse-grained clips, and finally split each clip into fine-grained sub-clips.\n\n### Task 2: Recognize the overall goal of the actions in this ego-centric video.\n\n**Overall Goal:**\nThe overall goal of the actions in the video appears to be preparing a meal with various ingredients, including vegetables, rice, and eggs, and involving other kitchen activities like cleaning and organizing.\n\n### Task 3: Temporally segment this video into clips.\n\nLet's group similar actions to identify subgoals within the same clip.\n\n#### Recognized Subgoals:\n1. **Initial Interaction and Setting Up**\n2. **Gathering Ingredients from the Fridge**\n3. **Preparing Vegetables**\n4. **Organizing and Preparing Cooking Area**\n5. **Cooking Vegetables and Rice**\n6. **Washing and Organizing Utensils**\n7. **Cooking Eggs**\n8. **Final Meal Preparation and Clean-Up**\n\n### Task 4: Further segment each clip into fine-grained sub-clips.\n\nActions in the same sub-clip often take place within a compact functional zone focusing on a secondary subgoal.\n\nHereâ€™s the JSON formatted output with detailed
