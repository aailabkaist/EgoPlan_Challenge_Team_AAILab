The same pattern applies to the entire video:\n  - Each clip will have its start and end timestamps.\n  - Under each clip, there will be sub-clips that detail the specific, more fine-grained activities ongoing within that clip.\n\nThis formatting ensures clarity and easy tracking of the categorized actions in the video."
